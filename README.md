Brahmi Keyboard Layout for Mac OS X

## Introduction

This manual and keyboard layout are designed to help you make use of the Brahmi keyboard layout (v1.0). This keyboard layout is developed to facilitate typing of Brahmi texts including vowel diacritics (saras), conjunct consonants (saṃyoga), and Brahmi numbers. It works with Mac OS X 10.10 onwards and is made available for downloads from Prachya Boonkwan’s Github (https://github.com/kaamanita/brahmi). The keyboard layout was designed by Prachya Boonkwan as a hobby using Ukelele Keyboard Layout Designer (available on App Store) and is distributed under the MIT License.

Note that the keyboard layout is based on Unicode character encoding. It cannot be installed on older operating systems that do not support Unicode and will not work with non-Unicode applications that rely on 8-bit character set. This manual is typeset using the Unicode-enabled font Google Noto Sans Brahmi.

9.	Log out and relog in to refresh the memory.

## Keyboard Mapping

### Consonants

Most consonants are mapped to their equivalent Sanskrit romanization on the keyboard layout. However, eight consonants are displaced due to linguistic dissimilarity between Sanskrit and English. Consonant aspiration is regularly marked by pressing the shift key.

| | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| 𑀓 /k/ | 𑀔 /kh/ | 𑀕 /g/ | 𑀖 /gh/ | 𑀗 /ṅ/ |
| [K] | Shift+[K] | [G] | Shift+[G] | ['] |
| 𑀘 /c/ | 𑀙 /ch/ | 𑀚 /j/ | 𑀛 /jh/ | 𑀜 /ñ/ |
| [C] | Shift+[C] | [J] | Shift+[J] | Shift+[Y] |
| 𑀝 /ṭ/ | 𑀞 /ṭh/ | 𑀟 /ḍ/ | 𑀠 /ḍh/ | 𑀡 /ṇ/ |
| [Z] | Shift+[Z] | [X] | Shift+[X] | Shift+[N] |
| 𑀢 /t/ | 𑀣 /th/ | 𑀤 /d/ | 𑀥 /dh/ | 𑀦 /n/ |
| [T] | Shift+[T] | [D] | Shift+[D] | [N] |
| 𑀧 /p/ | 𑀨 /ph/ | 𑀩 /b/ | 𑀪 /bh/ | 𑀫 /m/ |
| [P] | Shift+[P] | [B] | Shift+[B] | [M] |
| 𑀬 /y/ | 𑀭 /r/ | 𑀮 /l/ | 𑀯 /v/ |
| [Y] | [R] | [L] | [V] |
| 𑀰 /ś/ | 𑀱 /ṣ/ | 𑀲 /s/ | 𑀳 /h/ | 𑀴 /ɭ/ |
| [W] | Shift+[W] | [S] | [H] | Shift+[L] |


    
### Vowels

Almost all vowels are placed on the keyboard layout with respect to their equivalent Sanskrit romanization. However, the vocalic r and l are positioned at the keys [`[`] and [`]`], respectively.

Dependent form	Independent form

| | | | |
|-|-|-|-|
| /a/ | 𑀸 /ā/ | 𑀅 /ʔa/ | 𑀆 /ʔā/ |
| [A] | Shift+[A] | Alt+[A] | Shift+Alt+[A] |
| 𑀺 /i/ | 𑀻 /ī/ | 𑀇 /ʔi/ | 𑀈 /ʔī/ |
| [I] | Shift+[I] | Alt+[I] | Shift+Alt+[I] |
| 𑀼 /u/ | 𑀽 /ū/ | 𑀉 /ʔu/ | 𑀊 /ʔū/ |
| [U] | Shift+[U] | Alt+[U] | Shift+Alt+[U] |
| 𑀾 /ṛ/ | 𑀿 /ṝ/ | 𑀋 /ṛ/ | 𑀌 /ṝ/ |
| [`[`] | Shift+[`[`] | Alt+[`[`] | Shift+Alt+[`[`] |
| 𑁀 /ḷ/ | 𑁁 /ḹ/ | 𑀍 /ḷ/ | 𑀎 /ḹ/ |
| [`]`] | Shift+[`]`] | Alt+[`]`] | Shift+Alt+[`]`] |
| 𑁂 /e/ | 𑁃 /ai/ | 𑀏 /ʔe/ | 𑀐 /ʔai/ |
| [E] | Shift+[E] | Alt+[E] | Shift+Alt+[E] |
| 𑁄 /o/ | 𑁅 /au/ | 𑀑 /ʔo/ | 𑀒 /ʔau/ |
| [O] | Shift+[O] | Alt+[O] | Shift+Alt+[O] |
| 𑀁 /aṃ/ | 𑀀 /aṁ/ | 𑀂 /aḥ/ |  | 
| Shift+[M] | Alt+[M] | Shift+[H] |  |


As seen, vowel lengthening is marked by pressing the shift key. The independent form of a vowel can be achieved by pressing the Alt key. The consonant allophones can also be achieved by pressing the Shift and Alt keys.

One final remark to make here is that the short vowel /a/ does not have any glyphs. This is because each consonant has an inherent /a/ sound; therefore, one can simply type [K] to achieve the sound /ka/. However, the virtually empty keystroke [A] is introduced into the keyboard layout for ease of understanding of Sanskrit beginners who may sometimes accidentally type [K] + [A] in order to achieve the sound /ka/.

### Numbers

There are two numeral systems in Brahmi script: the digit one and the older non-digit one.

**The digit system** is based on the decimal numbers, similar to the current Hindu-Arabic numbers.

| 𑁦 | 𑁧 | 𑁨 | 𑁩 | 𑁪 | 𑁫 | 𑁬 | 𑁭 | 𑁮 | 𑁯 |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| [0] | [1] | [2] | [3] | [4] | [5] | [6] | [7] | [8] | [9] |

Note that the number zero is represented by a single middle dot. These Brahmi digits can be achieved by pressing their equivalent keystrokes in English.

The non-digit system, on the other hand, is not based on the decimal numbers because each numeral value is represented by a distinct glyph. These non-digit number glyphs can be achieved by pressing Alt + number.

| 𑁒 | 𑁓 | 𑁔 | 𑁕 | 𑁖 |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Alt+[1] | Alt+[2] | Alt+[3] | Alt+[4] | Alt+[5] |

| 𑁗 | 𑁘 | 𑁙 | 𑁚 |
|-|-|-|-|
| Alt+[6] | Alt+[7] | Alt+[8] | Alt+[9]	|

The values from 10 to 90 can be achieved by pressing a combination of Shift + Alt + (first digit).

| 𑁛 10 | 𑁜 20 | 𑁝 30 | 𑁞 40 |
|-|-|-|-|
| Shift+Alt+[1] | Shift+Alt+[2] | Shift+Alt+[3] | Shift+Alt+[4] |

| 𑁟 50 | 𑁠 60 | 𑁡 70 | 𑁢 80 |
|-|-|-|-|
| Shift+Alt+[5] | Shift+Alt+[6] | Shift+Alt+[7] | Shift+Alt+[8] |

| 𑁣 90 | 𑁤 100 | 𑁥 1,000	|
|-|-|-|
| Shift+Alt+[9] | Alt+[ - ] | Alt+[ = ]	 |

The non-digit system is preserved in the keyboard layout only for the purpose of ancient text transcription. Its use is rather discouraged because it under-represents the decimal system.
